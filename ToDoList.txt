KSP 1.1.3 / kOS v1.0

Grand projects:
-----------------

Satellite contact - Kerbin orbit
 - add runmode to wait for new instructions
 - try to fit required code into 20k

Satellite contact - Other bodies
 - develop inter-planetary transfer code

Probe Lander / Science
 - calculate how to change orbit to pass over specific geoposition
   - phasing change implemented
   - add a direct inclination change


Specific script actions:
--------------------------

lib_burn
 - add ability to use RCS for burns
 - check ahead to see if there is another engine to activate before staging

lib_warp
 - retest
 - how does it behave on going through altitudes where the warp speed is limited by KSP?
 - handle KAC alarms sensibly

lib_transfer
 - test use of lib_warp
 - add time limits to the node improvement
   - prevent it bringing the node too close to the ship or too far into the future
   - stop improving after a set time has elapsed
     - I have observed a couple of cases where it seems to have gone into a loop
     - perhaps the initial time jumps need to be larger
 - we can't change the inclination very well unless our node is in the right plane
   - fix by handling inclination separately?
     - will be needed for inter-planetary transfers
 - add ability to work out where will we re-enter and tweak this with a node
   - not sure if this would belong in lib_reentry
 - put node generation functions into their own libraries if the complete set ends up being rather large?
 - clean-up node improvement
 - clean-up body-to-moon
 - clean-up moon-to-body
   - calculate when the ejection angle will be correct rather than blindly iterating
 - develop moon-to-moon/body-to-body
   - develop support for transferring between moons of different bodies
 - develop support for gravity assists
 - move node improvement to new file?
   - add ability to pass in the scoring conditions as a function delegate

lib_orbit
 - (KSP's) orbit prediction functions don't work properly on a hyperbolic trajectory when given
   a time in the past
   - add extra checks to set the parameter time to be TIME:SECONDS if passed in time up to 1s ago?
   - or only worry about the calls from lib_transfer?

lib_lander_descent
 - clean-up
 - precision landing functionality
   - and/or avoiding slopes
 - after landing, try to detect if slope too great and abort to lift-off?
 - scan terrain ahead during warp to periapsis

lib_lander_ascent
 - clean-up
 - pitch angle could be based on prograde direction if within sensible limits

lib_dock
 - add more waypoints if needed
 - doesn't seem to like plotting a route if starting too close
 - clean-up

lib_rendezvous
 - moon avoidance
 - Hohmann transfers
 - implement a better rendezvous approach
   - if relative velocity magnitude and/or angle out of limits, plot a translation vector from
     the current velocity to one that points at the (offset) target position
   - avoiding swinging around too much
   - when further apart, use orbit predictions to determine best closing velocity
 - use station-keeping once relative velocity low
 - support RCS for fine corrections?

lib_steer
 - can we use angularvel to determine when we are stable?
 - two different sun-pointing functions
   - can we work out which one to use?

lib_skeep
 - add actual station-keeping
 - RCS support

lib_reentry
 - change deorbit burn to handle large inclinations
 - deorbit burn is tuned for an 85km by 85km orbit
   - extend to handle other circular orbits
   - could divide by zero if in Keostationary orbit(!)

lib_launch_common
 - the pitch program and heading are currently fixed. This can be improved:
   - adjust the pitch away from the program if climbing too rapidly / not quickly enough
   - adjust the heading/node to tweak the inclination during circularisation
     - may not be possible

run-modes:
-----------

1-49     launch (including various abort stages)
51-98    re-entry
99       *end*
101-149  transfer
201-249  lander descent
301-349  lander ascent
401-449  rendezvous
801-999  mission steps
