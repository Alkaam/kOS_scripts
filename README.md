# kOS_scripts
kOS scripts and libraries

Written for kOS v1 (pre) and KSP v1.1.3.

Well, most of the code has been written in kOS v0.17-v0.19, but I've updated it for the pre-release version of kOS v1. In particular, the file-handling uses commands that didn't exist before, so it would need adjusting to work with earlier versions.

To keep the file-sizes down, most of the code is uncommented and many function parameters have very short names. There is currently an open issue for filling out the documentation directory with detailed descriptions.
