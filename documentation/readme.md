# kOS_scripts documentation 

## Introduction

### Background

As with a lot of new kOS programmers, I started out by writing simple launch scripts. Once comfortable, I began developing a suite of libraries and boot scripts. There were two main drivers:
 * automating contracts such as tourist flights and satellite launches
 * learning and implementing interesting bits of orbital mechanics

There are many, many things that can be automated in Kerbal Space Program, so this is ongoing and probably never-ending work! I had always intended to make the scripts public once I got them to a high-enough standard. That isn't really the case at the time of writing, but the v1.0.0 pre-release of kOS prompted me to start putting the code online and documenting it properly. Being on Github, it means others could see and use the code, or even contribute to it. 

### Core concepts

Currently the script files are split into three different types, though two of these are almost identical:
 * boot scripts
 * init scripts
 * library scripts
